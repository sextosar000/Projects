            A fun fact you may or may not know about me... I play violin! I started playing about halfway through my 7th grade year, so I have been playing for roughly two and a half years. Presently, I play violin in WCHS's Symphony Orchestra. This is the top orchestra in the school, and it is such a fun experience. Violin has become a passion and helps as another outlet I have to release some stress after a long school day. And, no... I cannot play "The Devil Went Down to Georgia." Yet. <br><br>

            Just like many other high school girls, I enjoy singing. This is something I've been doing for fun since I was a little girl and continue to do today. I've grown up in a very musical household, and just about everybody else in my family sings for fun. Playing violin, I have also picked up a bit more vocal technique as it also helps me play. If you catch me with my headphones in and I'm alone, chances are you can also here me singing. Some of my favorite songs include:
            <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQVop3-OOXc">Breathe by Tomme Profitt (ft. Fleurie)</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKserM-i0_A">High Hopes by Panic! at the Disco</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWsc98ueoTI">Cry for Eternity by Dragonforce</a></li>
            </ul>

        <h1>Theatre</h1>

            Theatre is something that has sort of become a new love of mine. I've acted in smaller plays when I was younger and even a musical or two, however outside of that I lack much acting experience. This is one of the few performing arts that I'm actually more of a spectator on. This mainly comes from the fact that many of my peers happen to act and I enjoy going to support them! Warren Central High School also has an amazing performing arts program, and theatre is one of the many amazing sections that they support. I've loved going to watch Aida, Peter and the Starcatcher, And Then They Came For Me, Epic Proportions, and many other productions at the school, and I always look forward to seeing more!
