        <h1>Writing</h1>

        <p>
            Writing has been a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember. From about the time I was in kindergarten, I have always had a love for writing stories. This is a passion that has followed me throughout the years, and even continues today. Since I have had access to the internet I have fallen into roleplaying. The type of roleplaying I typically do involve tossing novel-esque paragraphs back and forth between me and another person or multiple people, and it has led me to meet many of the friends that I have today.<br><br>

        <h1>Drawing</h1>

        <p>
            Much like writing, I have been drawing and painting and generally crafting since I was a little girl. Before I was even in school, I had some type of creative medium in my hand. Be it painting, crayons, markers, colored pencils... I was doing it and I relished in it. Today I still draw, but not as much. Even if I do, they are the corner-of-the-paper doodles that teachers tend to not be so fond of. <br>
            Down below are drawings by some of my good friends and some of my favorite artists from 2018's #inktober challenge, and these are the types of drawings I go to most for inspiration! This inspiration can be used for... just about anything. It just gets the ideas flowing in my mind.
